# era-vocabulary

This is the repository where the vocabulary (ontology) for the European Union Agency for Railways is being developed and released. The online documentation for this vocabulary is available at https://data-interop.era.europa.eu/era-vocabulary/, and its URI is http://data.europa.eu/949/. All ontology components (classes, properties) use this base URI and are dereferenceable (e.g., http://data.europa.eu/949/Track).
